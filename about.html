    <h2 id="for-about1">What is the Gita Upadesh?</h2>
    <p id="desc1">
        The Bhagavad Gita is set in a narrative framework of dialogue between the Pandava prince Arjuna and his charioteer guide Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu.
        At the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, Arjuna despairs thinking about the violence and death the war will cause in the battle against his kin and becomes emotionally preoccupied with a dilemma.
        Wondering if he should renounce the war, Arjuna seeks the counsel of Krishna, whose answers and discourse constitute the Bhagavad Gita.
        Krishna counsels Arjuna to "fulfil his Kshatriya (warrior) duty" for the upholding of dharma.
        The Krishna–Arjuna dialogue covers a broad range of spiritual topics, touching upon moral and ethical dilemmas, and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war that Arjuna faces.
        The setting of the text in a battlefield has been interpreted as an allegory for the struggles of human life.

        Nearly 5000 years ago, the battlefield of Kurukshetra in India witnessed the ultimate confrontation — the Mahabharata war — a battle unto death between dharma, righteousness and adharma, irreligion.
        And who better to preside over this magnificent duel of opposites than the Lord of the Universe, Bhagawan Sri Krishna.
        The scene is set, the battle lines drawn. On one side is the army of Duryodhana and the Kauravas, gargantuan in size, representing adharma and headed by mighty generals such as Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Kripa and Ashwathama.
        On the other side is the army of Yudhishthira and the Pandavas, relatively small in size, representing dharma and having Sri Hari Himself on their side, thus assured of victory and striking fear in Duryodhana’s heart.
        <br><br>
        Leading the Pandava army from the front is the peerless archer Arjuna with Krishna as his charioteer.
        As the war is about to begin, the conch shells are blown first by Bhisma and the Kauravas and then followed by the Pandavas with Krishna blowing his mighty Paanchajanya that causes earth and sky to shudder.
        Arjuna then turns to his friend and charioteer and says “Hey Achyuta, take me between the two armies so that I can assess for myself what I have to contend with in this great war”.
        <br><br>
        With the chariot taken to the middle of the two great armies, Arjuna recognizes among the enemy, his patriarchs, grandfathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, nephews and friends.
        Struck with grief upon looking at all his relatives on the other side, Arjuna cries “Oh Keshava, I see before me, those whom I venerate, love and adore.
        And yet, I am condemned to take their lives in this sinful war that will do nobody any good. My body is trembling and my mouth is dry.
        I am overcome by compassion. Hey Janaardana, I desire neither victory nor the kingdom and its pleasures which seem pointless.
        I don’t want to kill them even if it results in lordship over all the three worlds. What is the purpose of this war that will result in the destruction of our entire clan?
        I would rather be killed by these relatives of mine than fight them. I am bewildered as regards to what am I to do.
        Hey Madhusudana, pray, help me, guide me.” Thus saying, the mighty Arjuna, despondent and distressed, lays down his arms and sinks down in the back of the chariot.
        <br><br>
        And thus commences the grand upadesha (teaching) of Krishna in the form of the ‘Divine Song’ or the ‘Bhagawad Gita’, the greatest expounding of the nectar of Vedic philosophy.
        <br><br>
        Sri Madhava takes Arjuna on a profound inner journey, effortlessly weaving His discourse through all the Yogas as only the master of all yogis can.
        The glorious ways of Jnaana or inquiry into Truth, Karma or selfless action and Bhakti or surrender to the Supreme all become clear as daylight to Arjuna as Shri Krishna unravels their mysteries, clarifies Arjuna’s every doubt and reveals to him the most confidential of secrets.
        <br><br>
        First, Krishna imparts Jnaana — the wisdom of Self-realization — with unequivocal clarity and great compassion, “Hey Partha, there was never a time and there never will be when I, you or these assembled warriors do not exist.
        For that which pervades all the entities of this universe is the indestructible Atman or Self. As the embodied being goes through childhood, youth and old age, it also goes from one body to another.
        Knowing this, the intelligent do not get deluded. Only the wise one to whom sorrow and happiness are the same is fit for immortality.
        Never is the Atman born, and never does It die. Birthless, eternal and undecaying, this embodied Self present in everyone can never be killed.
        Therefore you ought not to grieve for anyone present in the battlefield. Treating victory and defeat with equanimity, rise up to your duty and fight Oh Arjuna!”.
        <br><br>
        Then the benevolent Keshava teaches Karma — the right attitude toward discharging one’s duty, “Hey Dhananjaya, you have the right only to perform the action, never for its results.
        Become neither attached to the doership of action nor to inaction. Remain equipoised in success and failure. Such wisdom takes you beyond all evils and bondage and makes you a sthitaprajna, a steady one — free of desires and fears, without the idea of ‘me’ and ‘mine’ and devoid of pride.
        Everybody is only an instrument for action but deluded by ego, thinks ‘I am the doer’.
        Therefore dedicate all your actions to Me and free from egoism, engage in the battle of life”.

        And finally, the Blessed Lord Sri Hari reveals the way of Bhakti — loving devotion and surrender to the Supreme, “Hey Gudakesha, I am the eternal Self of all creatures, the beginning, middle and the end of all.
        Therefore accepting Me as the Supreme, meditate upon Me with single minded devotion. Being friendly and compassionate toward all creatures, ever content and resting the mind and intellect in Me, perform all your actions with equanimity.
        Abandon all other forms of rites and paths and take refuge in Me alone. I shall liberate you from all bondage and you will truly come to Me”.
        <br><br>
        Along the course of this scintillating journey through the cream of Vedanta, Shri Krishna out of great benevolence bestows upon his dear devotee Arjuna, the most coveted darshan of His Vishwarupam, the Universal Form.
        Arjuna, blessed specifically for the purpose of this darshan with divine eyes, beholds the Supreme Being, shining with the effulgence of millions of suns, decorated with the most wondrous garments, garlands and perfumes.
        He perceives within the Vishwarupam, which has no beginning, middle or end, every demigod, sage and celestial being, and every living and non-living entity. Everything is in Him and He is in everything.
        He is the sarva-kaarana-kaaranam, the cause of all causes. He is the source, the sustainer and the destroyer of all existence.
        Arjuna also visualizes a strange, unnerving phenomenon — every individual in the Kaurava army, and many on his own side, rushing into the Lord’s gigantic mouth as moths enter fire, to be devoured by Him.
        Shocked senseless by this sight and terrified by the fierce, blazing form, Arjuna begs the Lord, “Who are You? I don’t understand Your actions, oh Vishnu!”.
        The Lord replies, “I am Kaala, the world destroying Time. I have manifested to destroy almost everyone on this battlefield.
        Even without you, all the assembled warriors will be dead, annihilated by Me. Therefore, oh Savyasaachin, be merely an instrument, nimitta maatram, in destroying the enemies. Arise, Arjuna, and fight.”
        <br><br>
        Thus enlightened by his friend and Guru, Sri Hari himself, Arjuna glorifies the indescribable opulences of the Supreme Being with great love and devotion.
        Then saying “I shall do now as You ordain”, he picks up his mighty bow Gaandiva to go and and win the great war for the Pandavas against adharma.
        <br><br>
        We invoke through this divine conversation, the transcendental presence of Shri Krishna and Arjuna. As Sanjaya, the narrator of Bhagawad Gita, declares in the concluding verse: “Where there is Krishna, the Lord of all yogas, and Partha, the great wielder of the bow, there is fortune, victory, prosperity and unfailing wisdom”.
